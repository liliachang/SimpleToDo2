# SimpleToDo
SimpleToDo submission

This is an Android App demo of my first assignment in CodePath, implementing a simple ToDo list which can add, remove, and edit items.

Time spent: 4 hours. 

Can you successfully add and remove items from the todo list within your app? Yes.
Did you include support for editing todo items as described above? Yes.
Does your app persist todo items and retrieve them properly on app restart? Yes. 

Notes: My Android Studio took two and a half hours to install, not counting the time it took for my emulator to download, so I was pressed for time when implementing this app.
