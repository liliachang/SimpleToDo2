Submitted by: Lilia Chang

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x ] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [ ] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
*   This feature is buggy-- fails to edit the correct item.
* [ ] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart
*   Unsure of how to test this-- in my gif I closed the app and re-opened it.

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

My Android Studio took four hours to install, not counting the time it took for my emulator to download, so I was pressed for time when implementing this app.
